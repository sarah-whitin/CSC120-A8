- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the constructors in all 3. So I made at least 2 overloaded methods for each building superclass (3 in Cafe, 5 in house, and 3 in Library). The varying amount of constructors had to do with the amount of defaulted attributes and the amount of attributes that could be modified in the contructors. In Cafe and Library only name, address, and nFloors could be set in the constructor. However, House also can set hasElevator and hasDiningRoom in it's constructors, so it made sense to add more overloaded methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
