Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the constructors in all 3. So I made at least 2 overloaded methods for each building superclass (3 in Cafe, 5 in house, and 3 in Library). The varying amount of constructors had to do with the amount of defaulted attributes and the amount of attributes that could be modified in the contructors. In Cafe and Library only name, address, and nFloors could be set in the constructor. However, House also can set hasElevator and hasDiningRoom in it's constructors, so it made sense to add more overloaded methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I got part way through the kudos but then it started taking too long and I had to have a reality-check moment where I remembered that this assignment was already late and I should maybe come back to the kudos later in the semester if time allowed. I would recommend others do the same, try to kudos, see how it goes, and either you'll gain a few more skills but not finish or you will finish it and gain more skills.
My overall advice is to go through the readme and the rubric simulatenoulsy so that you can make sure you are following the instructions as precisely as possible.
